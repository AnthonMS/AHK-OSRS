## Deprecated OSRS AHK Bot

It has functionality to train a couple different skills, but the one I mostly created it for, it can prayer switch by hotkey. So when pressing the assigned hotkey to switch to Melee Prayer, it will automatically switch to Melee. It could do this for all 3 combat prayers.

But most of the functionality is deprecated and cannot be used anymore since it relied on a specific HTTP Plugin for runelite so it could check health, inventory and a buynch of other useful stats so It could drop assigned items when needed.


Maybe I will update it one day to use image recognition instead of the old HTTP plugin.

It has a simple GUI where everything can be configured from and specific elements could be enabled or disabled through this GUI and the gui could be set to be sticky to the runelite client so when that was moved/minimized and such, this GUI would follow it on either left or right side of the runelite window.
